# champion-island-games-modding

An extension for modding Champion Island Games. I may make some documentation for this later if needed.

**Current Features**
- X and Y coordinates on the top - Done

**Planned Features**
- Popup.html - Not Done
- Hitbox Transparency Slider - Not Done
- Mod Loader? - Not Done (seems hard to implement)
- Speed Adjustment Slider - Not Done

**How to use the extension:**
Firstly, only Chromium is supported, but there may be Firefox support in the future.
Anyways, you can either install the .crx version or just download the extension folder as a zip file (and put the folder into Chrome).
The .crx file is located here:

Also, the extension is currently not useful for anything yet, this will however change in the future.
**FAQ**
- When I install the extension, "null" pops up at the top on all the non GDCIG related pages.
This is because I am too lazy to make the extension work on only certain pages, it's much of a hassle, so this is the solution.
